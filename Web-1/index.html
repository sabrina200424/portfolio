    <h2 class="titlewriting">My Assessment</h2>
    <p class="first">The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. 
        Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message
        is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex
        relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.   
    </p>
    <p class="image"><img src="assets/images/webpage-image.jpg" alt="WebPage"></p> 
    <p class="alert">
        This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and 
        presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, 
        as simplification usually does. 
    </p>
    <p class="third">
        Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than 
        attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the 
        "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.

    <h3 class="questions">Questions</h3>
    <p class="fourth">
        Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly
        using HTML 
    </p>
    <h4 class="questiontitles">Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute
        and the "title" attribute. 
    </h4>
    <p class="answers">
        The title attribute acts to provide more context to a text. The alt attribute 
        provides more context to an image. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="questiontitles">Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the 
        dictionary below
    </h4>
    <p class="answers">
        To mark up a definition from a dictionary you can use the strong element to make the 
        words bold, so the reader could understand what the term is. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="questiontitles">Provide an example of a link pointing to your favorite site
    </h4>
    <p class="answers">
        <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" title="Here is a link to my favorite website.">Pinterest</a>
