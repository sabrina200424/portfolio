                My name is Sabrina Kabir and I am writing to you today because I'm interested in 
                the [  ] position at your company. I am currently a student at University of Arkansas
                at Little Rock majoring in Information Science with a minor in Business Information.
                Systems. I believe I would be a strong candidate to consider for this role because I
                possess experience in multiple technical skills. With coding skills entailing in SQL, 
                Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I was able to complete multiple projects for my classes.
                These projects were done both individually and in group settings. 
                From those group-settings, I was able to further develop my communication and time-management
                skills. 

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                For my skills in SQL, I was able to implement them in a variety of databases such as 
                MS SQL Server and Oracle. For related database work, I learned how to construct Entity-Relationship (ER)
                diagrams. However, these following skills, are not only limited to coding aspects. 
                I also have experience working with Excel and PowerBI. Making powerpoints and writing papers within 
                Microsoft Word and Google Docs are involved within my list of expertise as well. In addition, 
                I consider myself to be an individual who is eager to learn different skills, both technical 
                and soft. Thank you in advance for considering me for this position, and I look forward to 
                hearing from your team.  

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Sincerely, 

                <br>
                <br>
                Sabrina Kabir
