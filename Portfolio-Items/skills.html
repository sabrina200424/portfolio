            This is an example of my writing, more precisely, this is in the format of an 
            essay. In this essay, I delve into the topic of colorism. 
            More specifically, how does colorism pose as a burden to the mental health of South Asians? To read 
            and learn more about my essay, please click on the following link: <a href="assets/projects/Research-Argument-Paper.pdf">Research Argument Paper</a>

        <p class="writingintroduction">This is another example of my writing skills where I 
            write about a project analysis design. For this project design analysis, I discuss
            the introduction of the UV Analysis Design Project, the requirements of it,
            and the steps taken to develop the first page of the project. To get an in-depth review of
            my essay, please click on the following link: <a href="assets/projects/UV Index Project Analysis_ Design.pdf">Project Analysis Design</a>

        <p class="writingintroduction">This is a presentation slide that I created. In addition, 
            this presentation acts as part of my soft skills because through this presentation, I try to 
            convince my audience why my stance is important to consider. 
            Within this presentation I propose why game-based learning, specifically Kahoot, should have a
            strong presence within the classroom. For more information on the presentation, please click
