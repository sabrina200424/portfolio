        A dedicated, meticulous, and organized person who specializes in categorizing contents, 
        proposing solutions to different problems, and collaborating with others. An added experience
        of volunteering at a library setting has allowed me to strengthen my skills to communicate
        well with team members. I am actively seeking to pursue any technical or business related jobs
        in data analysis or front-end development that could allow me the opportunity to develop my technical
        and business skills while simultaneously familiarizing myself to work at a professional setting as well.
